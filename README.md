Various code snippets for modern Javascript including computer science fundamentals, data structures, algorithms and exploration of modern JS language features.

I've used modern ECMA syntax and a functional approach to all code in this repo. Many of these snippets are commonly found in tech interviews for front end engineers. There's LinkList and other Computer Science concepts found here as well for practice and study. 

Everything from adding Linked Lists to basic Promise and closure examples can be found here. This repo will grow over time and updating the internal documentation is crucial for the understandability of these files.

This repo is an attempt to illustrate my ability, knowledge and experience working with JavaScript, especially modern JS. The code is vanilla and does not rely on any third party code, libraries, frameworks, implementations, etc. 

As new language features are added to the ECMAScript spec this repo will be updated adding code to test, demonstrate and prove the new language features and my knowledge of them.

All code has been tested with Node on the command line. You can clone the repo and then run the files with Node using: node filename.js, where filename represents on of the snippets in the repo. For example to run the basic closure example navigate to the snippets directory that was cloned from GitHub and then run node basic-closure.js in a Terminal or Command Prompt. You'll see the output in the window you executed the node command from. 

In addition to running the code to see it's output comments have been placed near the log statements to assist the reader understand the purpose and functionality of each code example.
